# Harun's Store

## Project Overview
Harun's Store is a simple e-commerce web application that showcases a range of clothing products. Users can browse through the product listings, view detailed information about each product, and manage their shopping cart. The application is built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and vanilla JavaScript, providing a clean and responsive interface.

## Installation
To run Harun's Store locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd haruns-store
    ```

2. **Open `products.html` in your web browser**:
   You can simply double-click the `products.html` file or open it through a web server for testing.

   **Note**: If you want to serve files through a local server, you can use tools like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or `http-server` in Node.js.

## Usage
- Open `products.html` to view the products grid.
- Click on any product to view its detailed information on `product-detail.html`.
- Manage your shopping cart through the `cart.html` page (currently empty for further development).

## Features
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Dynamic product listings in a grid view.
- Detailed product views (placeholder for details).
- A placeholder for shopping cart functionality.

## Dependencies

- Font Awesome: for icons (included via CDN).

The `package.json` file was not provided, but if there are additional dependencies in the future, they should be listed here.
